##Installation

In order to use this app, you will need to get a Youtube API key. On line 42 of `script.js` go ahead and add your secret key!

Assuming you have node and npm nstalled on your machine, make use of these commands in npm first:
`npm install connect`
`npm install serve-static`

Then go to the directory and start using node on the server.js file: 
`node server.js`

Head to localhost:8080/index.html in your browser. Have fun!
